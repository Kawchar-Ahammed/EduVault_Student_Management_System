- `refactor/component-name` - Code refactoring

### Commit Message Guidelines

**Format:**
```
type(scope): brief description

Detailed explanation (if needed)

- Additional notes
- Breaking changes
- Issue references
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code formatting (no logic changes)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

**Examples:**

Closes #123
```

```bash
fix(database): resolve connection pool exhaustion

- Implement proper connection closing
- Add connection timeout configuration
- Update DAO classes to use try-with-resources

Fixes #456
```

## Style Guidelines

### Java Code Style

**Naming Conventions:**
```java
// Classes: PascalCase
public class StudentController { }

// Methods and variables: camelCase
public void enrollStudent() { }
private String studentName;

// Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
private static final String DEFAULT_PASSWORD = "student123";

// Packages: lowercase
package applications.controllers;
```

**Code Formatting:**
```java
// Indentation: 4 spaces (no tabs)
public class Example {
    private String name;
    
    public void method() {
        if (condition) {
            // Do something
        } else {
            // Do something else
        }
    }
}

// Line length: Maximum 120 characters
// Braces: Opening brace on same line
// Spacing: Space after keywords, around operators
```

**Documentation:**
```java
/**
 * Enrolls a student in a specific course
 * 
 * @param studentId The unique identifier for the student
 * @param courseId The unique identifier for the course
 * @return true if enrollment was successful, false otherwise
 * @throws SQLException if database operation fails
 * @throws IllegalArgumentException if parameters are invalid
 */
public boolean enrollStudent(String studentId, String courseId) 
        throws SQLException, IllegalArgumentException {
    // Implementation
}
```

### Database Guidelines

**SQL Style:**
```sql
-- Use uppercase for SQL keywords
SELECT s.student_id, s.full_name, c.course_name
FROM Students s
INNER JOIN Enrollments e ON s.student_id = e.student_id
INNER JOIN Courses c ON e.course_id = c.course_id
WHERE s.is_active = 1
ORDER BY s.full_name;
```

**Prepared Statements:**
```java
// Always use prepared statements
String query = "SELECT * FROM Students WHERE student_id = ? AND semester = ?";
try (PreparedStatement stmt = connection.prepareStatement(query)) {
    stmt.setString(1, studentId);
    stmt.setInt(2, semester);
    // Execute query
}
```

### UI Guidelines

**JavaFX Best Practices:**
```java
// Use FXML for complex layouts
// Keep controllers focused on logic, not UI setup
// Use CSS for styling instead of inline styles
// Implement proper event handling

// Example controller
@FXML
private TextField usernameField;

@FXML
private void handleLogin(ActionEvent event) {
    String username = usernameField.getText().trim();
    if (username.isEmpty()) {
        showError("Username is required");
        return;
    }
    // Handle login logic
}
```
